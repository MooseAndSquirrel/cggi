# cggi
C++ CGI Framework

# Why CGGI?
Because CCGI was already taken.

# But seriously, why did you do this?
I hate writing in PHP and Javascript, so I decided to make it easier to produce HTML
using a language I already pretend to know: c++.

# Why are you open-sourcing this code?
Just in case anybody finds my approach to the problem useful.
